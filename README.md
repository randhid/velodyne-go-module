# Velodyne Module

the `velodyne` module implements the [vlp-16 Velodyne Puck](https://ouster.com/products/hardware/vlp-16) as a modular viam camera component that implements point clouds using an unofficial golang implementation found at `go.einride.tech/vlp16`.
The Velodyne must be running locally at address `127.0.0.1`.
The only supported model is the `vlp-16`, which is the only model implemented by this repo.

## Configure a velodyne-go-module:vlp-16 Camera

Navigate to the **CONFIGURE** tab of your machine's page in [the Viam app](https://app.viam.com).
Click the **+** icon next to your machine part in the left-hand menu and select **Component**.
Select the `camera` type, then select the `rand:velodyne-go-module:vlp-16` model.
Enter a name or use the suggested name for your camera and click **Create**.

On the new component panel, copy and paste the following attribute template into your cameraâ€™s attributes field:

```json
{
    "port": <int>,
    "ttl_ms": <int>
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> For more information, see [Configure a Machine](/build/configure/).
